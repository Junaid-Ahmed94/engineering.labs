# Scenario

PyTorch is one of the main machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. 
It is catching up with TensorFlow accelerating the path from research prototyping to production deployment.
Recently, Pytorch community announched a number of technical contributions to enable end-to-end support for MLflow usage with PyTorch, 
including support for: 

- autologging via PyTorch Lightning
- TorchServe integration through a new deployment plug-in

and a sample end-to-end workflow targeting HuggingFace Transformers.

With this 1st labs, Mlops commuunity wants to test them and provide a possible end-to-end model lifecycle of Pytorch model using Mlflow.

## Teams

Teams involved in this scenario are:

- Team 1 : Michel Vasconcelos, Alexey Naiden, Varuna Jayasiri, John Savage
- Team 2 : Itirell, Mark Peters, Carlos Leyson, Semendiak
- Team 3 : Laszlo Sragner, yartem, Dimi, Paulo Maia
- Team 4 : Shadab Hussain, susana brandao, Godwin Ekainu, Josh
