# Operationalizing Pytorch Model with Mlflow

## Context

PyTorch is one of the main machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and 
natural language processing. It is catching up with TensorFlow accelerating the path from research 
prototyping to production deployment. Recently, Pytorch community announced a number of technical 
contributions to enable end-to-end support for MLflow usage with PyTorch. MLflow is an open source 
platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a 
central model registry. 

In this lab, MlOps community wants to test them and provide feasible ways to build end-to-end model 
lifecycles of Pytorch assets using Mlflow.

## Proposal

TBD

## Repo Organization

Following list describes the most relevant folders in which this lab is organized. Some folders in 
this repo are self-explanatory (like [_imgs_](imgs/)) and therefore aren'r mentioned in the list.

* [src](src/): Main source code folder. It comprises all software produced during this lab. _Src_ 
itself is organized into subfolders according to which components it belongs to;
* [docs](docs/): Binary documentation, drawings and reports produced during this lab;
* [infra](infra/): Infrastrucuture creation and definition code.
